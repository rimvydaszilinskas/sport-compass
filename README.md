# Sport Compass application

Simple Node.JS application. To avoid accidental reloads and data loss on user side, sessions were used to store data temporarly (till next app restart).
No databases were used, all the data is stored locally in data folder dummy.json file.

The application requires Node.JS to be installed.

To run the application: 
```
npm start
```
All the required packages will be automatically installed.
